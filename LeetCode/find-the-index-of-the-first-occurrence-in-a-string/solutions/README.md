## ðŸ§© String Search Algorithms (`strStr`)

### ðŸ“– Overview

This project implements the classic **substring search** problem â€” finding the first occurrence of a substring (`needle`) inside a larger string (`haystack`).

Currently, it includes a **naive (brute-force)** implementation written in Go.
Future updates will add the **KMP algorithm** and benchmark comparisons.

### ðŸš€ Features

* âœ… Simple and clear implementation
* âœ… No third-party libraries
* ðŸ§  Ready for future algorithm additions (KMP, etc.)
* ðŸ“Š Benchmark and performance tracking supported

### ðŸ§® Algorithm 1: Naive Search

**Description:**
The naive search algorithm checks for the substring match by iterating through each position of the `haystack` and comparing it with the `needle`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)`
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

Where:

* `n` â†’ length of `haystack`
* `m` â†’ length of `needle`
