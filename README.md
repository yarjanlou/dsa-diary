# 📘 dsa-diary —  Algorithm Journey (leetcode)

> 💡 *A log of every “aha!” moment in Data Structures & Algorithms.*
> 🧠 *Because mastery isn’t built overnight — it’s written one page.*

## 🚀 About This Repo

`dsa-diary` is my ongoing journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms challenges — from LeetCode, HackerRank, and beyond.
Here I record:

* 🧩 Clean, well-commented solutions
* 💡 Patterns discovered
* ✍️ Notes and reflections after each problem

Think of it as developer diary, where consistency matters more than perfection.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> “Don’t just solve — *understand the pattern*.”

* Start with brute force
* Identify repeating logic
* Optimize step by step
* Write down what learned
* Move on — but remember the pattern

Consistency > speed.
Understanding > memorization.

---

## ✨ Goals

* ✅ Solve 1 problems per week
* ✅ Review & refactor older solutions
* ✅ Document every *new pattern*
* ✅ Turn pain points into knowledge anchors

## 🌱 Why a Diary?

Because learning algorithms isn’t about streaks —
it’s about stories. Every problem solved is a small victory,
and every stuck moment is a future insight.

> “Write code. Take notes. Repeat.”

This repo keeps us accountable — and helps others to learn.
